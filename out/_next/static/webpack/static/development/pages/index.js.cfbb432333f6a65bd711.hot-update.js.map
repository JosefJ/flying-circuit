The Hacks Sweatshop should motivate hackers, makers and\n          developers to take their tools and skills into practice. The key goal of the hackathon is to prototype new\n          concepts that will help people to protect their digital self or exploit existing systems that were built to\n          constrain personal freedom.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <style jsx>{`\n        .about-section {\n          margin-top: 50px;\n          height: 400vh;\n          width: 100%;\n        }\n        .flowers {\n          position: absolute;\n          width: 96%;\n          margin: 0 2%;\n          z-index: 100;\n        }\n        .head {\n          position: absolute;\n          width: 90%;\n          margin: 0 5%;\n          left: 50%;\n          top: 50px;\n          z-index: 101;\n        }\n        .flying-circus-text {\n          position: absolute;\n          height: 300px;\n          z-index: 102;\n          top: 150px;\n        }\n\n        .manifesto {\n          text-align: center;\n        }\n\n        .manifesto-title {\n          font-weight: 700;\n          font-size: 1.4rem;\n        }\n\n        .manifesto-paragraph {\n          margin-top: 40px;\n        }\n      `}</style>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAzBA;AAAA;AAAA;AA4EA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
